# Simple-Text-Editor
This is a simple text editor which I have made using JAVA. Consider it as my first serious attempt at learning GUI programming in JAVA.

Description: This is a very simple text editor created by me. This text editor runs on JAVA Swing at 
its core. You can launch the program by entering the launch application which comes with the 
program itself. This implementation is very basic and is not useful for practical use. 

	I have planned to move this project to Github so that I can have some control over the versions. 
  The launcher application is actually a C program which is compiled into an executble.
The rest is JAVA. All the launcher program does is to run the .class file inside the JVM automatically
so we do not need to seperately run it everytime using the terminal.
